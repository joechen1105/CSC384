    '''Return a CSP object representing a Tenner Grid CSP problem along
       with an array of variables for the problem. That is return
       tenner_csp, variable_array
       where tenner_csp is a csp representing tenner grid using model_1
       and variable_array is a list of lists
       [ [  ]
         [  ]
         .
         .
         .
         [  ] ]
       such that variable_array[i][j] is the Variable (object) that
       you built to represent the value to be placed in cell i,j of
       the Tenner Grid (only including the first n rows, indexed from
       (0,0) to (n,9)) where n can be 3 to 8.
       The input board is specified as a pair (n_grid, last_row).
       The first element in the pair is a list of n length-10 lists.
       Each of the n lists represents a row of the grid.
       If a -1 is in the list it represents an empty cell.
       Otherwise if a number between 0--9 is in the list then this represents a
       pre-set board position. E.g., the board
       ---------------------
       |6| |1|5|7| | | |3| |
       | |9|7| | |2|1| | | |
       | | | | | |0| | | |1|
       | |9| |0|7| |3|5|4| |
       |6| | |5| |0| | | | |
       ---------------------
       would be represented by the list of lists
       [[6, -1, 1, 5, 7, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1],
        [-1, 9, 7, -1, -1, 2, 1, -1, -1, -1],
        [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 1],
        [-1, 9, -1, 0, 7, -1, 3, 5, 4, -1],
        [6, -1, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, -1, -1,-1]]
       This routine returns model_1 which consists of a variable for
       each cell of the board, with domain equal to {0-9} if the board
       has a 0 at that position, and domain equal {i} if the board has
       a fixed number i at that cell.
       model_1 contains BINARY CONSTRAINTS OF NOT-EQUAL between
       all relevant variables (e.g., all pairs of variables in the
       same row, etc.).
       model_1 also constraints n-nary constraints of sum constraints for each
       column.

    '''Return a CSP object representing a Tenner Grid CSP problem along
       with an array of variables for the problem. That is return
       tenner_csp, variable_array
       where tenner_csp is a csp representing tenner using model_1

       the Tenner Grid (only including the first n rows, indexed from
       (0,0) to (n,9)) where n can be 3 to 8.
       The input board takes the same input format (a list of n length-10 lists
       specifying the board as tenner_csp_model_1.
       The variables of model_2 are the same as for model_1: a variable
       for each cell of the board, with domain equal to {0-9} if the
       board has a -1 at that position, and domain equal {i} if the board
       has a fixed number i at that cell.
       However, model_2 has different constraints. In particular,
       model_2 has a combination of n-nary
       all-different constraints and binary not-equal constraints: all-different
       constraints for the variables in each row, binary constraints for
       contiguous cells (including diagonally contiguous cells), and n-nary sum
       constraints for each column.
       Each n-ary all-different constraint has more than two variables (some of
       these variables will have a single value in their domain).
       model_2 should create these all-different constraints between the relevant
       variables.
